Starting with the bad news first, there's lots of randomness when it comes to deciding a Vertical Trajectory.
Using your ContactZone(Left/Right Sour/Nice/Perfect) and Slap/Charge, 5 different angle ranges are given.
A range is randomly selected, and then an angle is randomly selected from within that range.

The good part is that you have some influence over if a range is picked.
Each of the 5 ranges for your hit has a percentage chance.
```

*** INSERT PIC OF HIGH NICE CHARGE HERE ***

```
The ranges will be identical for every character as long as they have the same Slap/Charge and ContactZone, but the probabilities will change based on your character's VerticalTrajPreference: Low, Mid, or High.
```

*** INSERT PIC OF LOW NICE CHARGE HERE ***

```
Characters with high traj will assign higher probabilities to higher angles than a character with mid traj or low traj (Most of the time).
Characters with low traj will assign higher probabilities to lower angles than a character with mid traj or high traj (Most of the time).

However you can influence these numbers. By holding Up/Down, you can move around the probabilities.
By holding Up, you remove the top 2 angle ranges, and their probability get added to the lowest angle range.
By holding Down, you remove the lowest angle range, and its probability gets added to the highest angle range.

This allows someone with low traj to move their high probability of the lowest angle range to the highest angle.

However, there will always be weirdness in MSSB.
Almost all ranges are symmetric based on left/right contact. Except for sour slaps.

All LeftSour Slaps (Batting Righty) have a similar looking probability range, with the highest angle having the highest probability.
All RightSour Slaps (Batting Lefty) have a similar looking probability range, with the lowest angle having the highest probability.

If you were to slap at a pitch that is either a change up, or a charge pitch (non-perfect) and you get sour contact, that hit will only ever have 1 vertical trajectory.
It's a steep angle, which makes for an easy out.
```

StarHits usually have only 1 angle for the entirety of contact, and do not care if you charge starred.
Some StarHits taper off at sour contact, so nice or perfect contact will still get a better angle, but all angles are reasonable.

Then you get to the Falcon Pop.
Falcon Pop has 1 angle per contact.
However, this angle rises from LeftSour (Batting Righty) to RightSour (Batting Lefty).
This means that if you're batting lefty your angles for Falcon Pop are super high, and easily catchable.
